# Filament-CPM
A collection of all code and videos used in the filament CPM project


Attached are the three models used in the thesis. Addtionally, all simulation videos may be found here.

There are three main scripts: the current model, the working perimeter model and the working filaments model. the latter two don't work as discussed but the current model has been patched to deal with the filament disappearnece. Still, the cell does not move so the next step is active_movement
